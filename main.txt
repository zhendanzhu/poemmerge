 A poem for the class


It was six men of Indostan 
    To learning much inclined, 
Who went to see the Elephant 
    (Though all of them were blind), 
That each by observation Might satisfy his mind. 

The First approached the Elephant, 
    And happening to fall 
Against his broad and sturdy side, 
    At once began to bawl: “God bless! but the Elephant 
Is very like a wall!” 

The Second, feeling of the tusk, 
    Cried, “Ho! what have we here 
So very round and smooth and sharp? 
    To me ’tis mighty clear 
This wonder of an Elephant 
    Is very like a spear !” 

The third approached the animal, 
    And happening to take 
The squirming trunk within his hands, 
    Thus boldly up and spake: “I see,” quoth he, “the Elephant 
Is very like a Snake!” 

The Fourth reached out an eager hand, 
    And felt about the knee. 
“What most this wondrous beast is like 
    Is mighty plain,” quoth he; “ 
’Tis clear enough the Elephant 
    Is very like a tree!” 

The Fifth who chanced to touch the ear, 
    Said: “E’en the blindest man 
Can tell what this resembles most; 
    Deny the fact who can, 
This marvel of an 
    Elephant Is very like a fan!” 

The Sixth no sooner had begun 
    About the beast to grope, 
Than, seizing on the swinging tail 
    That fell within his scope, 
“I see,” quoth he, “the Elephant 
    Is very like a rope!”
